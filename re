Deepavali, which means 'row of lights' in Sanskrit, is a powerful celebration of the triumph of good over evil, symbolized by the light we bring into our lives. Growing up in Tamil Nadu, we would decorate the house with vibrant kolams (rangoli) and light hundreds of oil lamps around our home to dispel darkness and welcome positivity. The festival is also marked by fireworks, with bursts of light and sound filling the night sky, creating an atmosphere of joy and excitement for everyone. Family gathers to prepare homemade sweets and savory snacks, including athirasam, a special treat that’s made only during this time of year. These traditional delicacies, made with care and shared with loved ones, make the festival even more memorable. A cherished tradition we follow is the early morning sesame oil massage from parents or grandparents, followed by a warm bath and dressing in new traditional attire. For newlyweds, it’s an even more memorable occasion, celebrated with extra joy by both families. Deepavali fills me with wonderful memories of time spent with grandparents, parents, siblings, neighbors, and friends.
