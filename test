1. Title Vendor Scope
Five managed title vendors were limited only to the refinance option (83) in the initial Obj1.01 code.
We noticed data for purchase/new originations from these vendors during the remediation period. Are purchase/new originations out of scope, and if so, why were they excluded?
2. Vendor Group IDs
Five group IDs (274675, 1111295, 1006489, 1201617, 950604) were explicitly hard-coded into the code (AC.GROUP_ID).
Upon reviewing the vendor table, we observed at least 16 group IDs (11 additional ones) associated with these same vendors (see table below):
Vendor	GROUP ID
ServiceLink	284372, 282312, 950604
First American Mortgage Solutions	280793, 1006489
Solidifi Title Agency of Utah	1115844
Solidifi Title Agency, LTD	1111420
Solidifi Title Company of California	1111955
Solidifi Title & Closing of Alabama, LLC	1130712
Solidifi Title & Closing, LLC	1130718
Solidifi Title Company of California	1111295
Linear Settlement Services	1111955
Mortgage Connect, LP	274675
Mortgage Connect of Texas	274675
Title Connect Inc.	274675
Radiant Title, LLC	379341
Radiant Escrow Inc	276972
Radiant Settlement Services Inc.	1130618, 1201617
Radiant Title Agency of Texas LLC	1130618
The highlighted group IDs in green are the only ones used in the DL query. However, 11 additional IDs were observed.
Clarification Needed: Why were these additional group IDs excluded? Are we missing an EA (Enterprise Architecture) document to confirm their exclusion?
3. Key Questions and Observations
Managed Vendors and Name Mapping:

There are over 30,000 third-party vendors. Many operate under different names with the same group IDs.
Please confirm if name and group ID mapping across these vendors is consistent and complete.
APR and Refund Disclosure:

How are APR overages being handled for customers where the extra title fees impacted APR calculations?
Is there a plan to provide corrected disclosures to affected customers?
Fee Tolerance Limits:

The contract does not explicitly mention tolerance limits for various title fees.
Are refunds issued before or after the tolerance limit threshold is reached?
Fee Misclassification and Overages:

How are misclassified fees being handled? Are there clear processes to ensure title-related overages are refunded consistently across vendors?
Missing Data in Tables:

There are several null values in the loan and group ID data (e.g., Loan_PURP_REF_ID).
Without these values, it is unclear how to confirm whether loans belong to refinance populations or not.
Please clarify how the initial population (83) was validated with incomplete data.
4. Data Discrepancies
We observed significant differences in counts between tables:
sql
Copy code
-- Count 1: From DEAL_PARTY table  
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Party_role_id) FROM EIW_D.COREBASE_PARTY_ROLE_PRIM;  
-- Result: 901,695  

-- Count 2: From CORBASE table  
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Party_role_id) FROM EIW_D.COREBASE_PARTY_ROLE;  
-- Result: 2,262,990  
This discrepancy limits observations, as the group ID subset in the second table may restrict results.
5. State-Specific Focus (PA and NY)
While the initial analysis covered all 50 states, the final population showed 83% of refunds occurring in PA and NY, despite these states representing only 30% of the population.
This creates a significant skew toward two states, raising UDAAP concerns.
Clarification needed:
Was the final population heavily influenced by contract nuances in PA and NY?
How does this outcome align with state-level fairness for customers across other states?
6. Next Steps
Confirm if purchase/new originations are out of scope for this remediation.
Provide documentation to justify the exclusion of the 11 additional group IDs.
Explain processes for managing APR adjustments, corrected disclosures, and refunds.
Clarify tolerance thresholds for overages and how refunds are determined.
Address data gaps (null values) and confirm population accuracy.
Justify the state-level skew in refunds, ensuring compliance with UDAAP standards.
