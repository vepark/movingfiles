Positive Test - if Total_intrest = 0; Negative Test - if Total_intrest ≠ 0:

QA Rationale: QA ensures that records with Total_intrest equal to 0 are included, confirming that interest calculations align with expected zero-interest conditions. Any non-zero interest values indicate an error or exception in the dataset.
Positive Test - if Impact_amount > 0; Negative Test - if Impact_amount ≤ 0:

QA Rationale: QA validates that all included entries have a positive Impact_amount, ensuring accurate representation of impactful transactions. Entries with zero or negative impact amounts are flagged for review or exclusion as they do not contribute to the intended dataset.
Positive Test - if CDTL_DETAIL_TYPE = 253; Negative Test - if CDTL_DETAIL_TYPE ≠ 253:

QA Rationale: QA confirms that only entries with CDTL_DETAIL_TYPE of 253 are included, as this specific detail type is critical for the analysis. Any other values are excluded to maintain data integrity.
Positive Test - if nsf_fee_amt = 0; Negative Test - if nsf_fee_amt ≠ 0:

QA Rationale: QA ensures that records with nsf_fee_amt equal to 0 are included, confirming the absence of non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees. Non-zero values are excluded to avoid contamination of the dataset with irrelevant fees.
Positive Test - if LOUC_Only_Amount ≠ 0; Negative Test - if LOUC_Only_Amount = 0:

QA Rationale: QA validates that all included entries have a non-zero LOUC_Only_Amount, ensuring meaningful data for analysis. Records with zero amounts are excluded as they do not meet the required criteria.
