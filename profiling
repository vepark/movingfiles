Data Profiling Proposal
Objective
To streamline the data profiling process for the QA team, making it systematic and automated using SAS, SQL, and ETL processes. This will ensure consistency, efficiency, and accuracy, allowing reviewers to focus on QA/QC without redundant efforts.

Steps and Processes
Identify and Gather Data Sources
Determine remediation data sources used over the past 5 years.
Collect the number of times these data sources were used.
Tools: SQL queries to extract data usage statistics from logs and databases.
Analyze and Rank Data Sources
Determine the top 500 data sources by the number of uses across all remediations.
Create a ranking table for easy reference.
Tools: SQL for data aggregation and ranking.
Identify Key Data Elements
Identify primary IDs, secondary IDs, date columns, and other critical fields.
Document the significance and relationships of these data elements.
Tools: SAS for data analysis and documentation.
Perform Data Profiling
Conduct column summary statistics (min, max, mean, mode, percentile, stddev).
Check for data completeness, consistency, and quality.
Detect value distributions and patterns.
Tools: SAS for automated profiling and reporting.
Create a Master Table
Develop a master table to consolidate data warehouse, database, table information, and profiling metrics (total counts, missing counts, % missing on main columns, primary and secondary column info, date columns, min date, max date, anomalies).
Schedule regular updates using Linux crontab.
Tools: SQL for table creation and updates, crontab for scheduling.
Automate Data Quality Checks
Implement automated checks for data quality dimensions (completeness, validity, uniqueness, consistency, timeliness, accuracy).
Define rules for identifying anomalies (e.g., variance between min and max values, distinct count vs. total counts, percent of zero/blank/null values).
Tools: SAS for rule-based validation and anomaly detection.
Maintain Data Lineage and Metadata
Track data lineage through ETL processes, documenting transformations and movements.
Maintain comprehensive metadata for each dataset, including data types, lengths, uniqueness, duplicates, and string patterns.
Tools: SAS and SQL for lineage tracking and metadata management.
Generate Reports and Dashboards
Create summary reports and dashboards to visualize data profiling results.
Provide easy access to these reports for the QA team.
Tools: SAS for report generation, visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI for dashboards.
Regular Audits and Continuous Improvement
Schedule regular audits to review and improve the data profiling process.
Implement feedback mechanisms to incorporate suggestions from the QA team.
Tools: SAS for audits and feedback analysis.

Detailed Workflow
Step 1: Identify and Gather Data Sources
sql
Copy code
SELECT data_source, COUNT(*) AS usage_count
FROM remediation_log
WHERE date >= '2019-01-01'
GROUP BY data_source
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

Step 2: Analyze and Rank Data Sources
sql
Copy code
SELECT TOP 500 data_source, COUNT(*) AS usage_count
FROM remediation_log
GROUP BY data_source
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

Step 3: Identify Key Data Elements
Primary ID: customer_id
Secondary ID: order_id
Date Columns: order_date, delivery_date
Step 4: Perform Data Profiling
sas
Copy code
PROC MEANS DATA=source_data N NMISS MIN MAX MEAN STDDEV;
  VAR numeric_columns;
RUN;

PROC FREQ DATA=source_data;
  TABLES categorical_columns / MISSING;
RUN;

Step 5: Create a Master Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE master_data_profile (
  data_warehouse VARCHAR(50),
  database VARCHAR(50),
  table_name VARCHAR(50),
  total_counts INT,
  missing_counts INT,
  percent_missing FLOAT,
  primary_key VARCHAR(50),
  secondary_key VARCHAR(50),
  min_date DATE,
  max_date DATE,
  summary_statistics JSON,
  anomalies JSON
);

INSERT INTO master_data_profile (data_warehouse, database, table_name, total_counts, missing_counts, percent_missing, primary_key, secondary_key, min_date, max_date, summary_statistics, anomalies)
SELECT ...
FROM profiling_results;

Step 6: Automate Data Quality Checks
sas
Copy code
PROC SQL;
  CREATE TABLE anomalies AS
  SELECT *
  FROM source_data
  WHERE (value_column BETWEEN min_threshold AND max_threshold)
  OR (DISTINCT value_count / total_count) > distinct_threshold
  OR (missing_values / total_values) > missing_threshold;
QUIT;

Step 7: Maintain Data Lineage and Metadata
Track changes using ETL process logs.
Maintain metadata in a centralized repository.
Step 8: Generate Reports and Dashboards
Summary Report: Generated weekly.
Dashboard: Updated daily, accessible via web portal.
Step 9: Regular Audits and Continuous Improvement
Monthly reviews with the QA team.
Incorporate feedback and adjust processes accordingly.

Visual Aids
Data Profiling Process Flow Diagram (provided earlier).
Key Metrics and Reports:
Include charts and graphs for visual representation of profiling results.
Summary statistics and anomaly detection visuals.

By implementing this systematic approach, the QA team can efficiently manage data profiling tasks, ensuring high data quality and consistency across all reviews. This proposal will reduce redundancy and enable the team to focus on more critical QA/QC tasks.
